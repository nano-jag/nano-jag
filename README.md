> I disowned Windows for failing me at critical time, but I use it for CAD and a few Windowns only tools.

I am a Nanomaterials Engineer, earned a Masters Degree in Biomedical Engineering, and a Bachelors Degree in Biotechnology. 
I believe Applied Mathematics and Physics as the core language of abstract, logical and ideal engineering, while Computation can add form, transform those abstractions into a reality via Software Engineering. 

By no means and standards, I am a software engineer, a CAD specialist, a Marketing strategist, or a Product UI-UX designer. But, I do exhibit those traits when required. I needed it so I am invested in learning it everyday.

I Co-Founded a startup *NanoKinetics Research Labs* (2016-2022) to collectively use engineering and existing technologies to create useful solutions in domains that affect our health and wellbeing (like curbing counterfeit food products, medicines, etc.). 

Working on the Startup, starting from nothing, taught me many things that I always yearned for while studying at University or working at Fraunhofer Institute.
I had used programming for computational modeling and image analysis, but when I always believed research should empower creation of customer facing products and not only result in journal publications or dissertations and die within 4 walls.

We needed custom tools for our work, and software to design and build products for customers, so I started devoting to learn software engineering. We were a small team of 3 engineers. It forced us to do everything that is needed. Today, after a few years in making I can take up an idea, dissect it to analyse for its feasibility and acceptance. Applying Design Thinking principles: Draw and outline a system design, an architecture and formulate specifications as per requirements before we do actual coding. 

I have worked on 3D-Modeling using CAD tool. Exported and optimize for 3D Printing for Prototype developments. 
As part of the team, I have worked on standalone IoT solutions using RPIs and MCUs used in manufacturing and automation.

By all means I am passionate about solving a meaningful problem and try to package idea into a product. Irrespective of the area of problem domain, I can delve right into the domain to glean the required knowledge.
